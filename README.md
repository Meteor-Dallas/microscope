# Microscope

This repo is for the tutorial app that we're building in the meetups. I'll be keeping this updated as we go.

If you would like to take a look at the finish product, you can find the original repo at https://github.com/SachaG/Microscope.

Feel free to fork this repo so you can work on it individually as well keep up with my live tutorial at the meetups.
