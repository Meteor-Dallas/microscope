# Microscope

This repo is for the tutorial app that we're building in the meetups. I'll be keeping this updated as we go.

If you would like to take a look at the finished product, you can find the original repo at [here](https://github.com/SachaG/Microscope).

Feel free to fork this repo so you can work on it individually as well keep up with my live tutorial at the meetups.

Also, check out the amazing [Discover Meteor book](http://themeteorbook.com) this tutorial is from.
